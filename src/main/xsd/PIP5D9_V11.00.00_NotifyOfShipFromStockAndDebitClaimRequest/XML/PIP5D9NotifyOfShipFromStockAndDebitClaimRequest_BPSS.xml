	<Documentation>This PIP is used to submit a claim for a debit against an authorization program, and to receive a claim response.  The Product Supplier may edit the product quantities, date of sale, and other information in the claim.  The claim is then accepted, rejected or placed in "Pending" status.  A disposition is generated for each line item. If accepted, the Product Supplier's financial system generates a credit to the Product Distributor. Rejected lines are reported with multiple reason codes, allowing the Product Distributor to close out the item or to fix the problem and resubmit the claim.
This PIP is executed when the product fulfillment status is known and the customer has been billed.</Documentation>
