## PIP2C10 V11.00.00

This PIP is designed to easily and efficiently communicate AML information about the parts that are
approved for a product from engineering to manufacturing. It supports the exchange of mappings from
internal part numbers to manufacturer part numbers, where “manufacturer” is loosely defined as the
last partner to affect a change to the part. It also supports the mapping of these part numbers to
supplier part numbers. The AML solves a variety of problems that impact quality, costing and lead
times. Quality is improved by specifying precise definitions of the parts that are approved and the
suppliers that are approved to supply them. The AML assists in costing and in planning lead times.
The AML provides traceability into the process of part acquisition. The AML also allows the
Integrator to respond whether it is able to build the product.

## PIP2C12 V11.00.00

The "Notify of Approved Manufacturer List Confirmation" Partner Interface Process™ (PIP) supports a
process in which the Qualification Owner for that product returns the requested information to the
Integrator. The Qualification Owner initiates the process and is the entity responsible for
qualifying parts that are approved for manufacture of the product and qualifying suppliers that are
approved for acquiring these parts. The Integrator is responsible for the product’s manufacture or
assembly.

## PIP5D5 V11.00.00

This PIP is used to submit a claim for a debit against an authorization program, and to receive a
claim response. The Product Supplier may edit the product quantities, date of sale, and other
information in the claim. The claim is then accepted, rejected or placed in "Pending" status. A
disposition is generated for each line item. If accepted, the Product Supplier's financial system
generates a credit to the Product Distributor. Rejected lines are reported with multiple reason
codes, allowing the Product Distributor to close out the item or to fix the problem and resubmit the
claim. This PIP is executed when the product fulfillment status is known and the customer has been
billed.
