	<Documentation>This PIP is designed to easily and efficiently communicate AML information about the parts that are approved for a product from engineering to manufacturing. It supports the exchange of mappings from internal part numbers to manufacturer part numbers, where “manufacturer” is loosely defined as the last partner to affect a change to the part. It also supports the mapping of these part numbers to supplier part numbers. The AML solves a variety of problems that impact quality, costing and lead times. Quality is improved by specifying precise definitions of the parts that are approved and the suppliers that are approved to supply them. The AML assists in costing and in planning lead times. The AML provides traceability into the process of part acquisition. The AML also allows the Integrator to respond whether it is able to build the product.</Documentation>
